There are a ton of notebooks out there that teach you the fundamentals of deep learning and PyTorch, so here the idea is to give you some basic introduction to deep learning and PyTorch at a very high level. Therefore, this notebook is targeting beginners but it can also serve as a review for more experienced developers.\n",

You also learned about the basic components that make up a neural network model such as the linear transformation layer, optimizer, and loss function. We then trained the model and tested its predictive capabilities. You are well on your way to become more knowledgeable about deep learning and PyTorch. I have provided a bunch of references below if you are interested in practising and learning more. \n",
