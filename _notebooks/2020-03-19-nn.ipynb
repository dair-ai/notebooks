The idea of the tutorial is to teach you the basics of PyTorch and how it can be used to implement a neural network from scratch. I will go over some of the basic functionalities and concepts available in PyTorch that will allow you to build your own neural networks. \n",

For advanced PyTorch users, this tutorial may still serve as a refresher. This tutorial is heavily inspired by this [Neural Network implementation](https://repl.it/talk/announcements/Build-a-Neural-Network-in-Python/5457) coded purely using Numpy. In fact, I tried re-implementing the code using PyTorch instead and added my own intuitions and explanations. Thanks to [Samay](https://repl.it/@shamdasani) for his phenomenal work, I hope this inspires many others as it did with me."

        "The loss keeps decreasing, which means that the neural network is learning something. That's it. Congratulations! You have just learned how to create and train a neural network from scratch using PyTorch. There are so many things you can do with the shallow network we have just implemented. You can add more hidden layers or try to incorporate the bias terms for practice. I would love to see what you will build from here. Reach me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarsar0) if you have any further questions or leave your comments here. Until next time!"
